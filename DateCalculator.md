Implement a set of functions to be a simple date calculator that takes into account leap years.
# Introduction #

The Gregorian Calendar was first instituted in 1582, but as you might imagine, it took time for it be used worldwide. The last conversion took place in 1918, and even today some countries follow a variant calendar. For this project assume that the rules of the calendar have been applied without correction from the present day back to 1 Jan 1600. As such, be careful when comparing your results to other date calculators that may be taking those historical discrepancies into account.


# Program Details #

The program implements various functions like +, -, ==, +=, -=, and most especially LeapYear which is used to calculate / determine if a year is a Leap year or not.
